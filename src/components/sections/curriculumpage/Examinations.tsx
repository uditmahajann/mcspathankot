Re-examinations may be conducted for such cases based on the school policy and the validity of the reason.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are the final grades calculated?",
    answer:
      "Final grades are calculated by combining the weighted scores from formative assessments (30%), summative assessments (30%), and term examinations (40%). For classes IX-XII, the weightage may vary according to board guidelines. The cumulative score is then converted to the corresponding grade as per the grading scale.",

    question: "Are there any provisions for students with special needs?",
    answer:
      "Yes, the school provides accommodations for students with special needs as per board guidelines. These may include extra time, scribes, readers, modified question papers, or separate seating arrangements. Parents should contact the Special Education Needs Coordinator well in advance to discuss specific requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can students access their examination results?",
    answer:
      "Examination results are published on the school's online portal and can be accessed using the student's login credentials. Physical report cards are also distributed during the Parent-Teacher Meetings scheduled after each term examination. For board examinations, results are published as per the respective board's schedule.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the promotion policy?",
    answer:
      "For promotion to the next class, students must achieve a minimum of 33% marks in each subject and maintain an overall average of 40%. Additionally, 75% attendance is mandatory. Students failing to meet these criteria may be required to repeat the class or take improvement examinations as per school policy.",
